Storm[1] is a realtime computation system developed by Nathan Marz at
BackType, a social web analytics company since acquired by Twitter.
It is now used for Twitter's Web Analytics product.

How to use it
-------------

Clone the repo and push to dotCloud:

    git clone https://github.com/gabrielgrant/storm-on-dotcloud.git
    dotcloud push mystorm storm-on-dotcloud

At the end of the push, you'll be provided the URL of the Storm WebUI.
To find the URL of Nimbus' Thrift service, run `dotcloud info mystorm`

What's included?
----------------

Storm consists of three physical components:

 - Nimbus (the cluster master)
 - Zookeeper (central hub for cluster discovery and config)
 - Workers

By default, deploying this repo will spin up one of each component,
with four worker processes running on the worker machine.

Scaling
-------

The Storm workers can be scaled like any other dotCloud service:

    dotcloud scale mystorm.worker=3

Note that the Nimbus shouldn't be scaled.

Adding additional worker processes can be done by adding additional
worker ports named "workerN" in the `dotcloud.yml` file.
